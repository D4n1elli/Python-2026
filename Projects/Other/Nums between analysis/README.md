# Numbers Between Analysis

A short Python program that asks the user for two numbers, start and end
With input validation, it checks if the user typed a start smaller than end, and if both are at least 2 apart.
- If yes, continues the program
- Else, it returns to the start input until the user types the right number

Then, the program runs a few functions and operations to check:
- How many numbers are between start and end
- What's their sum
- The sum's average
- How many of these numbers are positive and negative
- How many are even and odd.

Each category is stored in a variable and is then printed to the user

My first Python program, I had already studied Python in a very shallow way, but now I want to deepen my knowledge on this language.
