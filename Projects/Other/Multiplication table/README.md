# Multiplication Table

A Python program that asks the user for three inputs:
- Index number (number to be calculated)
- Start of the multiplication
- End of the multiplication

The program checks if the inputs are valid (start must be smaller than the end)
- if yes, the program continues
- otherwise, it repeats until such requirements are met

With these, it prints the multiplication table of the index number, with the start and end determined by the user
For an example, if you want to calculate the multiplication table of 5, starting from 4 and ending in 7, it will output:
- 5 x 4 = 20
- 5 x 5 = 25
- 5 x 6 = 30
- 5 x 7 = 35

The code loops until the user wants to quit by typing 0 on the index number
